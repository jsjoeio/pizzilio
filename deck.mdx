# a short story...

```notes
- I have a short story to tell before we begin. This will give you context behind why you should care about today's workshop and what we're building.
- When I was thinking about what I should teach for today's workshop, I knew I wanted to make it both fun and useful.
- So I did what might be a little risky. I emailed Jeff.
- I introduced myself and told him I was interviewing for DevEd role and asked if there's anything he needed us to build.
- He told me he was working on a potential partnership with Dominos. They wanted to be able to let customers order pizza over text but wanted to see a Proof of Concept.
- I told Jeff, "Great! We can build that during my workshop. It's next Tuesday and should be over around 6.
- He said he'd try and stop by to see it!
- Now that you have a bit of context around what we're going to build, I'd like to welcome you all to what I've deemed...
